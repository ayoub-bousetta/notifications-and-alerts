### What and Why ?

Alerts are something that everyone need this days, but they're not so available without extra css's classes. So that's beacause Css frameworks aren't that cool i made those simple Notification and ALerts available to use directly on you Web & Mobile.

#### Installing

You can use the dist/alerts.css directly on your project or if you want to improve/change something, i made the files available open source for you.pull it to your pc and use npm 
```
npm i
npm run dev
npm run build 
```


### How to use it

Simple you have like a div bloc with an alerts as initial class, After you can specify the type of this alerts by setting a name "success,errors,warns,info" and what kind is it {web is by default} "mobile,push". 

```
<div class="alerts warns"></div>
<div class="alerts info mobile"></div>
<div class="alerts errors push"></div>

```


#### Result
